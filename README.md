# Bondi Protocol

https://imgur.com/a/WPwKfSd

Shared Finance, Reimagined. Bondi is a decentralized application (dApp) built on a modern tech stack, designed to bring transparency, automation, and security to group finances. It replaces chaotic spreadsheets and group chats with an immutable, on-chain ledger for managing shared expenses, chores, and subscriptions.

Live Demo (You can fill this in once you deploy the project)

## The Vision
The traditional methods of managing shared finances are broken. They rely on manual tracking, trust, and awkward conversations, leading to disputes and a lack of transparency. Bondi solves this by leveraging blockchain technology to create a single source of truth. Our protocol is built on the core principles of:

Transparency: All transactions are recorded on-chain, verifiable by any member of the group.

Automation: Smart contracts handle the complex logic of expense splitting and recurring payments, eliminating human error.

Security: By utilizing a decentralized ledger, we remove single points of failure and ensure that user data and funds are managed with the highest level of security.

## Core Features
üîê Immutable Ledger: Cryptographically secured records prevent tampering and create a permanent, verifiable history of all group activities.

üí∏ Smart Expense Splitting: Automatically calculate who owes what with gas-optimized smart contracts. Supports complex splits by percentage, amount, or shares.

üìã Verifiable Chore Tracking: A fair and transparent system for shared responsibilities with on-chain records of task assignment and completion.

üîÑ Automated Subscriptions: Set up recurring payments that are automatically split and settled, eliminating the need to chase payments.

üó≥Ô∏è Decentralized Governance: BONDI token holders can stake their tokens to vote on protocol upgrades, fee structures, and the future of the ecosystem.
